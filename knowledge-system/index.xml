This happens when these words follow a number or expressions such as колко (how many?) or няколко (a few). In these cases, they will end with -a.
&amp;ldquo;един месец&amp;rdquo; - one month
&amp;ldquo;два месеца&amp;rdquo; - two months
&amp;ldquo;един ден&amp;rdquo; - one day
&amp;ldquo;няколко дена*&amp;rdquo; - a few days
This is called the numeral plural or counting form (бройна форма). This only applies to masculine nouns that do not represent people.</description></item><item><title>Bulgarian Closed Questions</title><link>https://www.okwilkins.dev/knowledge-system/slip-box/bulgarian-closed-questions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 18:28:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.okwilkins.dev/knowledge-system/slip-box/bulgarian-closed-questions/</guid><description>Asking a closed question (one that can be answered with yes or no) is quite simple.
